# Open Tools, Interfaces and Metrics for Implementation Security Testing

The OPTIMIST workshop is a forum to present and discuss new efforts that enable open and reproducible research in implementation security. The OPTIMIST emphasis is not on the artifacts themselves, but on the interfaces, components, libraries, hardware, and software tools that enable reproducibility and quality in implementation security testing.

## Current Activities of OPTIMIST

<span style="color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Follow up on our progress in the [OPTIMIST Hour](https://optimist-ose.org), a biweekly online meeting series to improve implementation security testing practice.</span>

	<b>Academia or Industry: Challenges of Building Open-Source Research Tools</b>

	<p>
	ChipWhisperer started as an open-source project for fault injection and side channel analysis, with the goal of making hardware widely available for researchers. This has resulted in a combination of both academic and industrial work, and this talk discusses how ChipWhisperer was developed, the challenges in trying to bridge the gap between various areas, and where more support is still needed. This includes how to build open-source projects that have long-term support without relying only on grants or short-term industry support, with specific details of how this was done with ChipWhisperer.

O'Flynn</a> is an Assistant Professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, NS, Canada. He works in hardware security research, and previously co-founded NewAE Technology Inc, which was a company spun out of the development of the ChipWhisperer project. As part of this work he is co-author of the Hardware Hacking Handbook, and has given numerous talks on ChipWhisperer and related research performed with the tools.

<b>Fault security analysis and verification: challenges and new directions</b>

<p>
Fault injection attacks pose a serious threat to the security of
cryptographic implementations, but also more generally to the security
of any embedded system.  Recent research has illustrated that these
attacks can now successfully target complex systems-on-chips operated by
equally complex software stacks.  As a consequence, the attack surface
is rapidly growing, putting further pressure on effective robustness
analysis tools.  In this talk, we will illustrate the challenges facing
fault security analysis, and suggest new directions for development.

research interests include embedded software and its interaction with

<b>Artifact Evaluation and Reproducibility at CHES</b>

<p> Artifact evaluation is an interactive process in which the
Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) tries to help authors publish
good-quality permanent artifacts (such as source code and data sets)
related to their research. In the CHES 2024 artifact evaluation,
authors of accepted papers could choose to have their research
artifacts evaluated against functionality and reproducibility
"badges." The use of reproducibility badges is now a standard
procedure in many non-IACR security conferences (USENIX Security, ACM
CCS, NDSS, ACSAC, and several IEEE conferences). We discuss various
aspects of functionality and reproducibility testing that we have
encountered during the 2024 period, especially related to hardware and
software artifacts.</p>

<p>As in all natural sciences, some results are easily reproducible,
while others are not (perhaps due to data acquisition methods) -- and
this does not necessarily make them lesser works! In the CHES context,
we repeatedly ran into muddy waters when authors asked the AEC to
evaluate works with leakage assessments (e.g., "TVLA") for
reproducibility rather than mere functionality. Since these are
essentially physical science experiments, specific questions about
laboratory procedures, calibration methods, and statistical treatment
arise. Despite some ISO standardization work in this area, the CHES
community should try to reach and document a further consensus on SCA
reproducibility. This would also help the industry to refine and
harmonize best practices in this area.  </p>

IACR CHES 2024. Markku started his career as a cryptographer at SSH
Communications Security in 1997, working on the now-ubiquitous SSH2
protocol. He has stayed with technical information security since
then, dividing his time between academia and the security
industry. Prior to moving back to his native Finland, he was with
PQShield in Oxford (2018-2023). Markku holds a Ph.D. in Information
Security from Royal Holloway, University of London (2009).  </p>

<b>Verification and evaluation of open-source implementations: the SMAesH study case</b>

<p> SMAesH is an open-source hardware implementation of AES protected against
side-channel analysis with the masking countermeasure. It achieves state-of-the
art performance, has been proven secure in the robust probing model and
withstood public scrutiny during the CHES 2023 challenge.
In this talk, we present SMAesH, discuss the verification and evaluation process
we followed to gain trust in its security, and we present the ongoing and future
work on the topic. Finally, we discuss the strength and weaknesses of SMAesH's
evaluation process.

<p> <a href="https://perso.cassiersg.be/">Gaëtan Cassiers</a> 
is a postdoctoral researcher at the Crypto Group of UCLouvain.
His research focuses on the analysis and design of side-channel countermeasures,
most prominently on masking techniques. He co-organized the CHES 2020 and 2023
side-channel evaluation challenges. In 2022 he co-founded the SIMPLE-Crypto
(non-profit) association that promotes open-source in the field of cryptography
with physical security. He is a developer and maintainer of two SIMPLE-Crypto
projects: SCALib, a side-channel security evaluation library and SMAesH, a
masked implementation of the AES.</p>
