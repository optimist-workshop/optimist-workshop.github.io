# Open Tools, Interfaces and Metrics for Implementation Security Testing

The OPTIMIST workshop is a forum to present and discuss new efforts that enable open and reproducible research in implementation security. The OPTIMIST emphasis is not on the artifacts themselves, but on the interfaces, components, libraries, hardware, and software tools that enable reproducibility and quality in implementation security testing.

<b>Fault security analysis and verification: challenges and new directions</b>

<p>
Fault injection attacks pose a serious threat to the security of
cryptographic implementations, but also more generally to the security
of any embedded system.  Recent research has illustrated that these
attacks can now successfully target complex systems-on-chips operated by
equally complex software stacks.  As a consequence, the attack surface
is rapidly growing, putting further pressure on effective robustness
analysis tools.  In this talk, we will illustrate the challenges facing
fault security analysis, and suggest new directions for development.

Bio: <a href="https://damien.courousse.fr/">Damien Couroussé</a> is with
CEA-List since 2011, as a Research Engineer and Senior Expert.  His
research interests include embedded software and its interaction with
hardware, compilation and runtime code generation for performance and
security, with a focus on hardware security.

## Panelists




## Call for Contributions 

As the OPTIMIST workshop is a forum to present and discuss new efforts that enable open and reproducible research in implementation security, the organizers and program committee invite submissions of proposals for talks.

Topics of interest for OPTIMIST include

* Datasets pertaining to Side-channel Analysis and Fault Analysis;
* Standard Libraries for Metrics in Implementation Security;
* Standard Application Programming Interfaces for Security Measurement Instrumentation;
* Standard Hardware Interfaces for Security Measurement Instrumentation;
* Standard Firmware Libraries and Hardware Targets for Security Evaluation;

Talks are 15 min in length, and are presented from the podium with slides, followed by a brief Q&A. The program committee will select among proposed talks based on fit for OPTIMIST and whether it will stimulate discussion and interest among the audience of hardware security practitioners, academics, and students. OPTIMIST welcomes talks based on both archival and non-archival work.

Each submission should be nonanonymous. A talk abstract must be at most 1 page, including a title, name of contributors and presenter(s), and a work description that can include figures and references. The authors are encouraged to refer to their paper published elsewhere before (if any), serving as the basis for the talk.
