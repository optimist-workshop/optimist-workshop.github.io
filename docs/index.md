# Open Tools, Interfaces and Metrics for Implementation Security Testing

The OPTIMIST workshop is a forum to present and discuss new efforts that enable open and reproducible research in implementation security. The OPTIMIST emphasis is not on the artifacts themselves, but on the interfaces, components, libraries, hardware, and software tools that enable reproducibility and quality in implementation security testing.

## Invited Speakers

We are thrilled to announce talks by the following invited speakers.

* [Colin O'Flynn](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/engineering/electrical/faculty-staff/our-faculty/professors/oflynn-colin.html), Dalhousie University, CA
* [Markku-Juhani Saarinen](https://www.tuni.fi/en/markku-juhani-saarinen), Tampere University, FI
* [Gaëtan Cassiers](https://perso.cassiersg.be/), UC Louvain, BE
* [Damien Couroussé](https://damien.courousse.fr/), CEA List, FR

## Call for Contributions 

As the OPTIMIST workshop is a forum to present and discuss new efforts that enable open and reproducible research in implementation security, the organizers and program committee invite submissions of proposals for talks.

Topics of interest for OPTIMIST include

* Datasets pertaining to Side-channel Analysis and Fault Analysis;
* Standard Libraries for Metrics in Implementation Security;
* Standard Application Programming Interfaces for Security Measurement Instrumentation;
* Standard Hardware Interfaces for Security Measurement Instrumentation;
* Standard Firmware Libraries and Hardware Targets for Security Evaluation;

Talks are 15 min in length, and are presented from the podium with slides, followed by a brief Q&A. The program committee will select among proposed talks based on fit for OPTIMIST and whether it will stimulate discussion and interest among the audience of hardware security practitioners, academics, and students. OPTIMIST welcomes talks based on both archival and non-archival work.

Each submission should be nonanonymous. A talk abstract must be at most 1 page, including a title, name of contributors and presenter(s), and a work description that can include figures and references. The authors are encouraged to refer to their paper published elsewhere before (if any), serving as the basis for the talk.
