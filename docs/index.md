# Open Tools, Interface and Metrics for Implementation Security Testing

The OPTIMIST workshop is a forum to present and discuss new efforts
that enable open and reproducible research in implementation
security. The OPTIMIST emphasis is not on the artifacts themselves,
but on the interfaces, components, libraries, hardware, and software
tools that enable reproducibility and quality in implementation
security testing.

Topics of interest for OPTIMIST include

* Datasets pertaining to Side-channel Analysis and Fault Analysis;
* Standard Libraries for Metrics in Implementation Security;
* Standard Application Programming Interfaces for Security Measurement Instrumentation;
* Standard Hardware Interfaces for Security Measurement Instrumentation;
* Standard Firmware Libraries and Hardware Targets for Security Evaluation;
